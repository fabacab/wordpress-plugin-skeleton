# Common toolchain utilities like package managers, task runners, and
# other such tools typically place configuration files or other stuff
# in the project directory. These aren't actually source code either,
# so we can safely ignore them.

# Bower is a package manager for JavaScript and CSS libraries.

# The node_modules folder is the canonical place where Node.js
# tools place their libraries (called "modules" in Node lingo).
node_modules/

# The _site folder is where we publish the promo site for this
# project by using Jekyll, a static site generator.
_site/

# Since Jekyll is distributed as a Ruby package (called a Gem),
# we use Bundler, a Ruby Gems package manager, to configure it.
.bundle/

# We also don't want to commit the Gems that Bundler installs
# since they are only useful for developers. But they're kept
# in the same directory we use for other libraries that we do
# want to distribute with the final build, so we only ignore
# Bundler's subdirectory, but not the other directories.

# The next set of file paths relate to developer documentation and are

# This is a personal documentation generator config file. You can use
# this file to customize the way the project's documentation looks to

phpdoc.xml

# The developer documentation itself is, by default, written to this
# subfolder. Since it gets automatically generated, we don't want to
# save it in the code repository itself.
